            <p>
                I am Dipesh Kishor Chhetri, 20 years old, and I am originally from a beautiful town called Waling in Syangja, Nepal. Currently, I live in Banasthali, Kathmandu and pursuing my bachelor's degree from Herald College Kathmandu located in Naxal.
                I am a very curious and hardworking person, and I am deeply interested in learning about technology and web development. I spend most of my time learning new skills like Java, Python, MySQL, and I enjoy the process of building and creating things for the internet.
                Besides academic, I like to explore different places of Nepal, read books, moreover, I like to play online video games as well. My goal for the future is to become a skilled professional in the tech industry and to use my  knowledge to create useful and beautiful websites.
